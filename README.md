# Geological Observations Application

## Background
This app was build in 2016 and aims to display a number of geological observations on an interactive map.
The addition of a WMS layer allows these observations to be shown within their geological context.
The GetFeatureInfo capability of the WMS layer is exploited to populate popups with useful information.
