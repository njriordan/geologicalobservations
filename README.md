# Geological Observations Application

An app built using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript to illustrate a number of geological observations.
The addition of a WMS layer allows these observations to be shown within their geological context.
The GetFeatureInfo capability of the WMS layer is exploited to populate popups with useful information.
